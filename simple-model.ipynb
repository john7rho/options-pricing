    "1. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 0.16471762016671287\n",
    "   - This measures the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors).\n",
    "   - In the context of option prices, this suggests that on average, the model's predictions deviate from the actual Black-Scholes prices by about $0.16.\n",
    "   - Given that option prices can vary widely, this error might be considered relatively small, but its significance depends on the typical price range of the options being modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.07295523932601272\n",
    "   - This represents the average absolute difference between the predicted prices and the Black-Scholes prices.\n",
    "   - It suggests that, on average, the model's predictions are off by about $0.07 compared to the Black-Scholes prices.\n",
    "   - This is lower than the RMSE, indicating that there aren't many large outliers in the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mean Percentage Error: 16.61479047061372%\n",
    "   - This shows the average percentage difference between the predicted prices and the Black-Scholes prices.\n",
    "   - A 16.61% error suggests that, on average, the model's predictions deviate from the Black-Scholes prices by about 16.61% in either direction.\n",
    "   - This error seems relatively high, indicating that while the absolute differences might be small, they represent a significant portion of the option's price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "- The model appears to be predicting option prices that are reasonably close to the Black-Scholes prices in absolute terms (MAE of $0.07).\n",
    "- However, the percentage error of 16.61% suggests that these differences are still significant relative to the option prices themselves.\n",
    "- This could indicate that the model is struggling with certain aspects of option pricing, possibly with very low-priced options where small absolute errors translate to large percentage errors.\n",
    "- There might be room for improvement, perhaps by adjusting the model architecture, increasing the training data, or incorporating additional features.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the model, you might consider:\n",
    "1. Increasing the complexity of the LSTM network\n",
    "2. Adding more relevant features\n",
    "3. Using a larger dataset or a longer historical period\n",
    "4. Experimenting with different preprocessing techniques\n",
    "5. Trying alternative model architectures or ensemble methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that while the Black-Scholes model is widely used, it also has its limitations. The differences between your model's predictions and Black-Scholes prices could potentially capture some real-world factors that the Black-Scholes model doesn't account for."
